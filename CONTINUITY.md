# Continuity Ledger

- Goal (incl. success criteria):
  - Review current uncommitted changes and report prioritized findings (bugs/risk).
- Constraints/Assumptions:
  - Respond to user in Japanese; keep edits ASCII unless file already uses non-ASCII.
  - Create a topic branch before implementation.
  - Use TDD: add/adjust test before implementation.
  - Run relevant backend tests/builds before responding (document failures if any).
  - Do not revert unrelated local changes; stop and ask if unexpected changes appear.
- Key decisions:
  - User asserts `reqwest 0.12.24` includes wasm support equivalent to `reqwest-wasm`.
- State:
  - REPORTED
- Done:
  - Reviewed uncommitted diffs across backend/frontend for archived user feature additions.
- Now:
  - Assessing user feedback about reqwest wasm support.
- Next:
  - Inspect diffs and prepare review findings per guidelines.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
  - None.
- Working set (files/ids/commands):
  - `backend/src/handlers/admin/mod.rs`
  - `backend/src/main.rs`
  - `backend/src/repositories/user.rs`
  - `frontend/src/api/client.rs`
  - `frontend/src/api/types.rs`
  - `frontend/src/pages/admin_users/*`
