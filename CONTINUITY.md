# Continuity Ledger

- Goal: Address all review comments for PR #94 (Admin Users) to move it towards merging.
- Constraints/Assumptions: Maintain MVVM, LF endings, and DI consistency.
- Key decisions: Fix all Clippy warnings to ensure `-D warnings` passes.
- State: FIXING_WARNINGS
- Done:
    - [x] Initial robustness audit (ApiClient).
    - [x] Analysis of PR #94 review comments:
        - [ ] Unused import `CreateUser` in `panel.rs:2`
        - [ ] Build failing with `-D warnings` (likely due to unused imports/variables)
- Now:
    - Fixed unused import in `panel.rs`.
    - Performing definitive project-wide audit for remaining `.expect(` calls.
- Next:
    - List specific items to fix.
    - Implement fixes in `admin_users` module.
- Open questions:
    - None.
- Working set:
    - `frontend/src/pages/admin_users/view_model.rs`
    - `frontend/src/state/auth.rs`
